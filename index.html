            <h2>Hi, I'm Anuroop Jayan!</h2>
            <p>I'm an undergraduate student passionate about full stack development. Welcome to my portfolio!
                As a 2nd-year Computer Science student, I’ve been building my skills in full-stack development through
                coursework and independent learning.
                I enjoy working on the visual side of applications, creating clean and simple user interfaces, while
                also learning how to build the logic that runs behind the scenes.
                I’m always trying to improve my understanding of core programming concepts, strengthen my
                problem-solving skills, and explore how different parts of a system work together. My goal is to keep
                growing as a developer and build real-world applications that are functional, user-friendly, and easy to
                maintain.

                    <h3>Project One</h3>
                    <p>
                        <h4>The Apple Store Problem </h4>
                        For this project, I designed an object-oriented program that simulates a simplified version of
                        an app store.
                        The system manages app listings, user accounts, downloads, and app ratings submitted by
                        registered users.
                        This helped me practice organizing data, structuring classes, and applying core OOP concepts in
                        a real-world style scenario.
                    </p>

                        <h4>The Vaccine Tracker Problem</h4>
                        This project focused on modeling a vaccination tracking system.The program manages vaccine distribution 
                        through registered sites, keeps track of patient records, and generates proof of received vaccine doses. 
                        It helped me practice organizing data, designing modular programs, and applying object-oriented programming principles.
