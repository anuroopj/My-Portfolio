I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science student passionate about learning and building software. This repository showcases my coding projects, skills, and learning journey.

Projects:
1. The Apple Store Problem

An object-oriented program simulating a simplified app store. The system manages app listings, user accounts, downloads, and user-submitted ratings. This project helped me practice organizing data and applying core OOP concepts.
